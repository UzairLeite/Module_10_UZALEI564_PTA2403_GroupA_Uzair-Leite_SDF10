## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

API's are a set of rules that allow one set of software to communicate with another. API's can be defined as a method where user request and recieve information. API's are essential for usuability and functionality and it offers an enhanced experience. We used a fetch API to call a method and log it for an explanation during one of the classes.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An interface determines how components interact with each other. Where, an API is a set of rules and tools used for building software and applications. Interfaces are used within a program to ensure different parts can interact in a consistent way. Where, APIs are used to allow different applications or systems to interact with each other.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

API components: 
- Web API's; Web services, interfaces that operate over the internet.
- Operating System API's; provide a bridge for software applications to request and carry out basic operations
- Library and Framework APIs; are sets of rules, protocols, and tools bundled together in software libraries or frameworks
- Database APIs;  enables communication between an application and a database
- Hardware APIs; allow software to interact, control, and retrieve data
- RESTful API's; set of principles for providing standards between computer systems on the web
- Remote API's; the standard of interactions for running applications on different machines

  I find RESTful to be the most intriguing and useful:
  
  - Scalability: Scaling out and balancing loads across multiple servers becomes easier without storing session information.
  - Simplicity: Requests can be handled independently, making the logic on the server side simpler and more predictable.
  - Flexibility: Clients can send requests in any order without relying on prior requests.


4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

We used Fetch API's to call a method and had it logged in the console to see if the code was running. Was used during a class session. 

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I feel confident with the Fetch API and RESTful API's
I am struggling to fully grasp the concept of API's and all the information relating to API's. 
To improve on my skills I will watch more videos of how to use API's and implement them properly. I will also do small activities to help me understand API's and how better to use them when I write my own code.
